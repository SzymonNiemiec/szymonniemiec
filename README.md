## Hi there 👋

### ⚛️ About me

Senior Frontend Developer with a mission to create inclusive, high-quality web experiences. With expertise in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I’ve spent over 7 years building applications that are not only visually stunning but also accessible, performant, and easy to maintain.

I believe that great software is built through teamwork, clear communication, and a shared commitment to excellence. Whether it’s leading frontend architecture discussions, optimizing performance, or advocating for best practices, I’m always focused on delivering value to both users and the business.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me with my hands in an aquarium, exploring the art of aquascaping.
